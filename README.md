# My first RayCaster
 Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
 was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
 make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.

 To do this, we used MinilibX, which is a simplified library based on X-System.

 project developed by me and https://github.com/nyykooo
